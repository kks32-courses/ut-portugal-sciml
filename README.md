# UT - Portugal Scientific Machine Learning

> Krishna Kumar

A 6-hour synchronous online course designed to equip engineers,
scientists, and technical professionals with the fundamental principles and practical skills of
Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) and its application in accelerating scientific computing
tasks. The course focuses on three key pillars: integrating physics into neural networks (PINNs),
learning solution operators for families of PDEs (Operator Learning), and leveraging automatic
differentiation for end-to-end differentiable simulations. Participants will gain hands-on
understanding through demonstrations using industry-standard tools like Python, PyTorch, and
JAX within the Google Colab environment. The course is structured into three focused 2-hour
modules, designed for live online delivery.

### Course Objectives
Upon completion of this course, participants will be able to:
1. Understand the core principles of SciML, combining data-driven methods with scientific 
domain knowledge (PDEs/ODEs).
2. Implement and apply Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve both forward
(PDE solving) and inverse (parameter discovery) problems.
3. Grasp the concept of Operator Learning and implement basic DeepONets to accelerate
the solution of parameterized PDEs.
4. Utilize Differentiable Programming and Automatic Differentiation (AD) to build
differentiable scientific simulations for applications like gradient-based optimization and
solving complex inverse problems.
5. Gain practical exposure to relevant Python libraries (PyTorch, JAX) for SciML
applications.

### Target Audience
This course is designed for:
● Engineers & Scientists : Professionals in various domains (Mechanical, Civil,
Chemical, Environmental, Aerospace, etc.) who utilize computational modeling and
simulation and seek to integrate AI/ML for enhanced performance and discovery.

● Researchers : Academics and R&D professionals looking to apply cutting-edge SciML
techniques to their research problems.

● Data Scientists & ML Practitioners : Individuals with ML background interested in
applying their skills to scientific and engineering domains.
